# Binarized network bat calls
Master thesis on binarized neural network evaluation for detecting and classifying bats calls

You can find most of the data used in the thesis in the logs files except for the models using XGBoost and ResNet.
The ResNet performance files can be found in the models folder and the files are labelled depending on the binary or float version of ResNet and dated from 09/05/22.
The XGBoost models using the first version architecture are stored in files dated from 09/05/22.
The optimized versions of XGBoost models can be found in the files from 13/02/22 and 14/02/22, the commit is also called optimized models.
The networks using the reduced XGBoost with 250 estimators with max depth at 10 can be found in files 04_03_22_17_59_02 for the binary and 14_04_22_10_57_47 for the double precision version.
